module: graphiant_data_exchange
short_description: Manage Graphiant Data Exchange services, customers, matches, and invitations
description:
  - This module provides comprehensive Data Exchange management capabilities for Graphiant's B2B peering platform.
  - Enables creating, deleting, and querying Data Exchange services and customers.
  - Provides service-to-customer matching operations with automatic match response file management.
  - Supports invitation acceptance with gateway service deployment and VPN configuration.
version_added: "25.11.0"
notes:
  - "Data Exchange Workflows:"
  - "  - Workflow 1 (Create Services): Create Data Exchange services that can be shared with customers."
  - "  - Workflow 2 (Create Customers): Create Data Exchange customers (nonGraphiant peers)."
  - "  - Workflow 3 (Match Services): Match services to customers and establish peering relationships."
  - "  - Workflow 4 (Accept Invitation): Accept service invitations for non Graphiant customers."
  - "Configuration files support Jinja2 templating syntax for dynamic configuration generation."
  - "Match responses are automatically saved to JSON files in the output directory near the configuration file."
  - "The module automatically resolves names to IDs for sites, LAN segments, services, customers, and regions."
  - "All operations are idempotent and safe to run multiple times without creating duplicates."
  - "For accept_invitation operation, minimum 2 gateways per region are required for redundancy."
  - "Check mode (C(--check)) is not supported for this module. Data Exchange operations involve complex multi-step workflows with state changes that cannot be safely simulated. The C(accept_invitation) operation provides a C(dry_run) parameter for validation without API calls."
options:
  operation:
    description: "The specific Data Exchange operation to perform. C(create_services): Create Data Exchange services from YAML configuration (Workflow 1). Configuration file must contain C(data_exchange_services) list with service definitions. Services define peering services with LAN segments, sites, and service prefixes. C(delete_services): Delete Data Exchange services from YAML configuration. Services must be deleted after customers that depend on them. C(get_services_summary): Get summary of all Data Exchange services with tabulated output. Returns service details including IDs, names, status, role, and matched customers count. C(create_customers): Create Data Exchange customers from YAML configuration (Workflow 2). Configuration file must contain C(data_exchange_customers) list with customer definitions. Customers can be non-Graphiant peers that can be invited to connect to services. C(delete_customers): Delete Data Exchange customers from YAML configuration. Customers must be deleted before services they depend on. C(get_customers_summary): Get summary of all Data Exchange customers with tabulated output. Returns customer details including IDs, names, type, status, and matched services count. C(match_service_to_customers): Match services to customers from YAML configuration (Workflow 3). Configuration file must contain C(data_exchange_matches) list with match definitions. Automatically saves match responses to JSON file for use in Workflow 4. Updates existing match entries or appends new ones based on customer_name and service_name. C(accept_invitation): Accept Data Exchange service invitation (Workflow 4). Configuration file must contain C(data_exchange_acceptances) list with acceptance details. Requires matches_file from Workflow 3 for match ID lookup. Supports dry-run mode for validation without API calls. Configures full IPSec gateway deployment with dual tunnels, static routing, and VPN profiles. C(get_service_health): Get service health monitoring information for all matched customers. Returns tabulated health status including overall health, producer prefix health, and customer prefix health. Supports both consumer and provider views."
