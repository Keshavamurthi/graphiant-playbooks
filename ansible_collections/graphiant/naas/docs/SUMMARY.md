# Docusite Setup Summary

## ✅ Setup Complete

The docsite structure has been successfully set up and tested. The build process works correctly.

## What Was Created

1. **Sphinx Project** (via `antsibull-docs sphinx-init`):
   - `docs/conf.py` - Sphinx configuration
   - `docs/build.sh` - Automated build script
   - `docs/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
   - `docs/antsibull-docs.cfg` - antsibull-docs configuration
   - `docs/rst/` - Directory for generated RST files

2. **Documentation Files**:
   - `docs/README.md` - Overview of documentation structure
   - `docs/DOCSITE_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup guide
   - `docs/QUICK_START.md` - Quick reference guide
   - `docs/build_docsite.sh` - Custom build script (alternative)

3. **Generated Documentation**:
   - `docs/build/html/` - Final HTML documentation site
   - Successfully built with all modules documented

## Quick Start

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source ~/venv_pb/bin/activate

# Navigate to docs directory
cd ansible_collections/graphiant/naas/docs

# Build the docsite
./build.sh

# Preview locally
cd build/html
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Build Status

✅ **Build Successful**
- RST files generated from module documentation
- HTML site built with Sphinx
- All modules included (with validation warnings that don't block the build)

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Validation Errors** (Optional):
   - Some modules have validation warnings about description formatting
   - These don't block the build but should be fixed for best documentation quality
   - Run: `antsibull-docs lint-collection-docs --plugin-docs .` to see details

2. **Publish Documentation**:
   - See `DOCSITE_SETUP.md` for publishing options (GitHub Pages, etc.)
   - Or use the existing documentation site at `https://docs.graphiant.com/docs/graphiant-playbooks`

3. **Automate Builds** (Optional):
   - Set up GitHub Actions to auto-build on releases
   - See antsibull-docs documentation for examples

## Files to Commit

The following files should be committed to the repository:
- `docs/conf.py`
- `docs/build.sh`
- `docs/requirements.txt`
- `docs/antsibull-docs.cfg`
- `docs/.gitignore`
- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/DOCSITE_SETUP.md`
- `docs/QUICK_START.md`
- `docs/build_docsite.sh` (optional)

**Do NOT commit**:
- `docs/rst/` (generated RST files - auto-generated by antsibull-docs)
- `docs/build/` (generated HTML files - auto-generated by Sphinx)

These are now in `docs/.gitignore` and have been removed from git tracking.
