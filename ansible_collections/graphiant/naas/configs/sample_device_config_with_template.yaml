# Sample Device Configuration File (With Template)
# =================================================
#
# This is a simplified configuration file that uses a user-defined template
# to generate the final API payload. This approach reduces repetition and
# makes it easier to configure multiple devices with similar settings.
#
# Usage:
#   Use this config file with the template file:
#   ansible-playbook playbooks/device_config_management.yml \
#     -e "config_file=sample_device_config_with_template.yaml" \
#     -e "template_file=device_config_template.yaml" \
#     -e "operation=configure"
#
# The template (device_config_template.yaml) will expand these simple
# variables into the full API payload structure.
#

# Common settings applied to all devices
common:
  primary_dns: "8.8.8.8"
  secondary_dns: "8.8.4.4"
  region: "us-west-2 (San Jose)"
  config_ver_name: "dns_config_changes_version_1"
  config_ver_desc: "Configure custom DNS and region"

# List of devices to configure with template
devices:
  - name: "edge-1-sdktest"
    config_ver_desc: "Configure DNS and region for edge-1"
    # Optional device-specific overrides
    # primary_dns: "1.1.1.1"

  - name: "edge-2-sdktest"
    config_ver_desc: "Configure DNS and region for edge-2"

  - name: "edge-3-sdktest"
    # Override region for this device
    region: "us-east-1 (N. Virginia)"
    config_ver_desc: "Configure DNS and region for edge-3"
