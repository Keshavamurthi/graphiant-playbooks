# Sample Data Exchange Matches Configuration
# This file demonstrates how to match Data Exchange services to customers
#
# The system will:
# 1. Read match configuration from the 'data_exchange_matches' list
# 2. Resolve customer and service names to IDs
# 3. Use the specified servicePrefixes (user-selected, not all service prefixes)
# 4. POST to v1/extranets-b2b-peering/match/service-to-customer with the payload
#
# Note: You can select specific service prefixes to include in the match.
# This allows fine-grained control over which service prefixes are available to each customer.
