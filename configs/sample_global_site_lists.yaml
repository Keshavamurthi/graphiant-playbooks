# Sample Global Site Lists Configuration
# This file demonstrates how to configure global site lists
# 
# The system will:
# 1. Read site names from the 'sites' list
# 2. Look up site IDs using v1/sites/details API
# 3. Generate the correct API payload with site IDs
# 4. POST to v1/global/site-lists with the payload
